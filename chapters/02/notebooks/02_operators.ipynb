    "C# has lots of operators, which act the same as Java:\n",
    "* **Arithmetic operators** that perform arithmetic operations with numeric operands\n",
    "  * +, -, *, /, % (remainder), ++, --\n",
    "* **Assignment operators** that perform an assignment into an operand\n",
    "  * =, +=, -=, *=, /=, ...\n",
    "* **Comparison operators** that compare numeric operands\n",
    "  * <, >, ==, >=, <=, !=\n",
    "* **Boolean logical operators** that perform logical operations with bool operands\n",
    "  * &, |: bitwise AND, OR\n",
    "  * &&, ||: conditional AND, OR\n",
    "  * ^: XOR\n",
    "* **Bitwise and shift operators** that perform bitwise or shift operations with operands of the integral types\n",
    "  * ~: bitwise complement\n",
    "  * << and >>: left and right shift operators\n",
    "  * &, |: bitwise AND, OR\n",
    "  * ^: XOR\n",
    "* **?? operator**\n",
    "  * returns the left operand if not null, otherwise the right operand\n",
    "  * ??= assigns the right operand if the left operand is null\n",
    "* **Null conditional operator**\n",
    "  * test for null before accessing a member\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also possible to overload these operators, this will be discussed later in this course. But you can always take a look at the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/operator-overloading).\n",
