The amount of slides in this chapter are very limited. We're using interactive notebooks to make it more interactive.
> Pun intended.

To start learning this chapter:
- Open Visual Studio Code
- Install the `.NET Interactive Notebooks` extension
    > Check the install guide, normally it should already be installed.
- GIT Clone the repository

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HOGENT-Web/csharp.git
```
- Open the `chapters/02/notebooks` folder
- Read them through and play with the code.
