### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# What is REST?

- **R**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer, [Â°Roy Fielding in 2000](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm)
- **architectural style** for designing networked applications
- nothing more but **using current features of the web**
  - 40y old matured and widely accepted HTTP protocol
  - standard and unified methods (POST, GET, PUT and DELETE)
  - stateless nature of HTTP
  - easy to use **U**niform **R**esource **I**dentifier

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# What is REST?

- leverages these features with 5 constraints:
  - uniform interface
  - client-server
  - stateless
  - cachable
  - layered system

> <a href="https://restfulapi.net/rest-architectural-constraints/" target="_blank">Read more about these constraints</a>

---
### What is REST?
# Uniform interface

> Everything is a **Resource**

- fundamental concept of REST
- has
  - data
  - relationships to other resources
  - methods that operates against it to allow for accessing and manipulating the associated information

Examples:
- [www.hogent.be/image/logo.gif]() (Image resource)
- [www.hogent.be/students/1001]() (Dynamically pulled resource)
- [www.hogent.be/videos/v001]() (Video resource)
- [www.hogent.be/home.html]() (Static resource)

---
### What is REST?
# Uniform interface

> Every resource is identified by a **Unique Identifier**

- **U**nifirm **R**esource **L**ocator identifies the online location of a resource
- directory structure-like URIs

Examples:
- Get customer details with name "Shiv": [www.hogent.be/Customers/Shiv]()
- Get customer details with name "Raju": [www.hogent.be/Customers/Raju]()
- Get orders for customer "Shiv": [www.hogent.be/Customers/Shiv/Orders]()
- Get orders for customer "Raju": [www.hogent.be/Customers/Raju/Orders]()

---
### What is REST?
# Uniform interface

> Communication is done by **Representation**

- use some **media type**
  - often JSON (`application/json`)
  - or XML (`application/xml`)
- set the appropriate **HTTP headers**
  - `Accept`: what do you expect as input?
  - `Content-Type`: what are you returning?

---
### What is REST?
# Client-Server

* client and server should be able to evolve independently
* client should be able to do all it needs with the available resource URI's

---
### What is REST?
# Stateless

- every request is independent
- server does not need to remember previous requests and state
- no sessions, no history...

<br />
<img src="./images/REST-stateless.png" width="70%" class="center" />

---
### What is REST?
# Cacheable

* all responses should be made cachable (if possible)
* good caching ensures the server scales better (less requests to process)
* and the client responds faster

---
### What is REST?
# Layered System

* REST allows to spread data and API over several servers
* example:
  * Server A: API
  * Server B: data storage
  * Server C: authentication
* big advantage: servers are able to scale independently

---

class: dark middle

# Ain't no REST for the wicked
> HTTP methods and status ranges

---
### What is REST?
# HTTP methods

> Describe resource **functionality** with **HTTP methods**

.center[
| Method | Description                             |
| ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| GET    | retrieve a representation of a resource |
| POST   | create new resources and sub-resources  |
| PUT    | update existing resources               |
| PATCH  | partially update existing resources     |
| DELETE | delete existing resources               |
]

This ensures **uniform interfaces** accross multiple REST APIs

---
### What is REST?
# HTTP status ranges in a nutshell

- `1xx`: hold on
  - the request was received, continuing process
- `2xx`: here you go
  - the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
- `3xx`: redirection
  - further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
- `4xx`: you made a boo boo
  -  the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
- `5xx`: I made a boo boo up
  - the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request

> **An API is only as good as you (yes, you) document it.**

---
### Document your API
# OpenAPI

- **O**pen**A**PI **S**pecification (OAS)
- formerly known as Swagger
- YAML or JSON
- standard, programming language independent description of a REST API
- only specifies functionality
  - not which implementation
  - not what dataset
- **OAS 3.0**: both people and machines can view, understand and interpret the functionality of a REST API
- from documentation the client code can be generated

# Building a REST API

Complete the following tutorial
[Create a web API with ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/build-web-api-aspnet-core/)

> The tutorial is great but has some flaws, which we will tackle later.

> Note that the tutorial is **mandatory** to go forward.

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# .NET HTTP REPL
Running the REPL is awesome but complex requests like POST or PUT can be quite tedious, we'd rather type in complex objects in a text editor we love (VS Code). Let's do something about that first.

- Install REPL (if not already done)

```
dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.dotnet-httprepl
```

- Connect to the REPL and set the default editor Visual Studio Code on Windows in this case (you only have to do this once)

```
httprepl http://localhost:5000
pref set editor.command.default "C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\Code.exe"
pref set editor.command.default.arguments "-w"
```

> Linux and macOS are also supported by reading the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/web-api/http-repl/?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=macos#set-the-default-text-editor">docs</a>

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# .NET HTTP REPL
- Start the REST API in the terminal
```
dotnet run
```
- In another terminal connect to the REPL or re-use the one you had before
```
httprepl http://localhost:5000
```
- POST Request in to the `PizzaController`
```
cd pizza
post
```
- Edit the JSON file that popped-up in VS Code
- Save the file and close (CTRL+S and CTRL+W)

---

### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Issues with the tutorial
Let's say we want to add a property to the `Pizza` class.
```
public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; }
*   public DateTime Created { get; set; }
}
```
- The `Pizza` model is used as a `DTO` and a `Domain` class.
- **Overposting** is possible
  - What if the client should not be able to set this property?
- **Overfetching** is possible
  - What if the `Pizza` has an entire Graph of properties and lists?
- **No validation **
  - What if the max size of the name should be 200 characters?

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Overposting
```
public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; }
*   public DateTime Created { get; set; }
}
```
- Run the following .NET HTTP REPL commamds and fill in

```
cd pizza
post 
```
```
{
  "id": 0, // Why should a POST set the Id, database should do this
  "name": "",
  "isGlutenFree": true,
  "created": "2021-10-19" // We should not be able to set this
}
```

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Overfetching
```
public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; }
*   public List<Ingredient> Ingredients {get;set;} //Example
*   public List<Person> OrderedBy {get;set;} //Example
*   public DateTime Created { get; set; }
}
```
- Should a client be able to see all the ingredients?
  - `List` of pizza's is different then a `Detail` view
- Should a client be able to see all the people who ordered this Pizza?
  - Depends, who is the client and what can he/she see?
- Should a customer know when we first introduced the pizza?
  - Probably not

> **It depends on the use case/client**

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Versioning
```
public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get; set; } // Renamed
*   public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; } // We'll remove this one
}
```
- Let's rename `Name` to `DisplayName`
- Remove `IsGlutenFree` because nobody cares anymore

> You can no longer **update the Domain model** since you'll break clients that rely on it.

---
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Versioning
Are you the only one using your API and **are you in control** when the client and server are updated?
- **Don't** version your API, there is no need to.

For **all other reasons**, version your API.
- Note that mobile clients aren't updated that easily. A user of the mobile app needs to update the app even if the new version is pushed.

> We won't go into versioning in this course since <a target="_blank" href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3562355/how-to-use-api-versioning-in-aspnet-core.html">this tutorial</a> explains everything you need to know.

### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# **D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bjects
Fixes the following issues:
- Overposting
- Overfetching
- Updating Domain classes and not breaking clients
- ~~No validation~~ (see later)

Characteristics:
- Donât contain any business logic
- Only contain data
- Can be shared with (C#) clients

---
### **D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bjects
# Example
```
public static class PizzaDto{
  public class Index {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
  }
  public class Detail {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public List<IngredientDto.Index> Ingredients { get; set; }
  }
  public class Create {
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
  }
  public class Edit : Create { // Caution with Inheritance
    public int Id { get; set; }
  }
}
```

---
### **D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bjects
# DTO vs Domain
Suffix or make it clear it's a DTO, can be in a /Shared folder or project
```
public static class PizzaDto{
  public class Index {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
  }
}
```
Usually in the /Models folder or in a separate project called Domain
```
public class Pizza
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string DisplayName { get; set; }
    public bool IsGlutenFree { get; set; }
}
```

---
### **D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bjects
# Exercise
- Make a /Shared folder in the `ContosoPizza` project
- Add a `PizzaDto` class as you see fit.
- Adjust the `PizzaController`
  - Receives a DTO when needed
  - Returns a DTO when needed.
    - Map the Domain `Pizza` class to a DTO.

# Solution
It all depends on the use case, so there is no real solution here.

name: input-validation
### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# Input validation?

- **Testing the incoming data** to make sure it's **valid**
- User or application may send malicious/wrong data
- **Prevents improperly formed data** from entering the system
- Databases usually check data, but the earlier you check, the better
- Prevents input validation attacks:
    - SQL injection
    - XSS attacks
    - Buffer overflow
    - Overposting

---
### Input validation
# FluentValidation

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/index.html">FluentValidation</a> is one library to validate in .NET

Installation using the dotnet CLI

```
dotnet add package FluentValidation
```

---
### FluentValidation
# How does it work?

Take the following class as an example

```
public class CustomerDto {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public decimal Discount { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
}
```

---
### FluentValidation
# How does it work?

If we want to validate the given `CustomerDto` class, we should create a validator
class which inherits from `AbstractValidator`.

```{cs}
public class CustomerDtoValidator : `AbstractValidator<CustomerDto>` { }
```

---
### FluentValidation
# How does it work?

Within this class, define a constructor with all validation rules.

```{cs}
public class CustomerDtoValidator : AbstractValidator<CustomerDto> {

  public CustomerDtoValidator() {
    `RuleFor(customer => customer.FirstName).NotNull();`
    `RuleFor(customer => customer.Discount).GreaterThan(0).LessThan(1);`
  }
}
```
You should never validate domain models this way, since they should be valid from the point-of-creation.
DTO's however, are different and can be validated this way. 

> Read more about Always valid vs not always valid <a href="https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/posts/always-valid-domain-model/" target="_blank">here</a>.

---
### FluentValidation
# As nested classes

```
public class CustomerDto {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public decimal Discount { get; set; }
  public string Address { get; set; }
  
  public class Validator : AbstractValidator<CustomerDto> {
    public Validator() {
    RuleFor(customer => customer.FirstName).NotNull();
    RuleFor(customer => customer.Discount).GreaterThan(0).LessThan(1);
    }
  }
}
```

> This can improve the readability and maintainability.

---
### Input validation
# FluentValidation Middleware
Middleware is triggered **before or after a request** to a controller comes in. You can use it to automagically validate the DTO's. Without having to worry if the request is valid.
Change the `Create` method of the `PizzaController`
```
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(PizzaDto.Create dto)
{    
    var pizza = PizzaService.Add(new Pizza{Name = dto.Name,IsGlutenFree = dto.IsGlutenFree});
    return CreatedAtAction(nameof(Create), new { id = pizza.Id });
}
```

> Note that the `Pizza` is using a default constructor which is valid for a demo purpose. But not in production applications.

---
### Input validation
# FluentValidation Middleware
Change the `PizzaService.Add` to return a `Pizza` object
```
public static Pizza Add(Pizza pizza)
{
    pizza.Id = nextId++;
    Pizzas.Add(pizza);
    return pizza;
}
```
Add the ASP.NET Core package
```
dotnet add package FluentValidation.AspNetCore
```

Add FluentValidation as middleware in Startup.cs
```
services.AddControllers()
        .AddFluentValidation(fv => {
            fv.RegisterValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<PizzaDto.Create.Validator>();
            fv.ImplicitlyValidateChildProperties = true;
        });
```
> Read more about middleware validation in ASP.NET <a href="https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/aspnet.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

---
### Input validation
# FluentValidation Middleware
Run the REPL:
```
cd pizza
post
```

```
{ // Edit the file as follows:
  "name": "",
  "price": -15,
  "isGlutenFree": true
} // Save and close the file in vs code
```
Response:
```
{ // some stuff is left out here for brevity.
  "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": {"Name": ["'Name' mag niet leeg zijn."],
    "Price": ["'Price' moet groter zijn dan '0'."]
  }
}

### gRPC
# What is gRPC?

- **R**emote **P**rocedure **C**all
- Open-source
- Developed at Google
- **Call a method on a server as if it's a local method** on the client
- Uses **protocol buffers**
- Defines
    - **services**: expose the methods
    - **messages**: what is sent around

# What is gRPC?

<img src="./images/gRPC-example.svg" class="center" width="70%" />

> Clients and servers can talk to each other in a variety of languages/environments

---
### gRPC
# Protocol buffers

- Mechanism to **serialize data**
- **Independent** of language, platform...
- Like XML or JSON but smaller, faster and simpler
- Works with so called messages
- Messages transformed into a **binary** format before being sent
- Every property of a message gets a number
    - Used to parse incoming/create outgoing buffers


```{proto}
message Person {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 id = 2;
  optional string email = 3;
}
```

---
### gRPC
# Typical protocol buffers

- Domain objects
- Requests
- Replies

---
### gRPC
# Services

- **Expose methods** on a server
- Clients can call these methods
- Defines methods which
    - take a **message as argument**
    - can **return a message**

```{protobuf}
service Greeter {
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}

### Ain't no REST for the wicked
# GraphQL (extra)

As an extra you might want to use GraphQL in .NET. Go through this LinkedIN Learning
tutorial on your own (not mandatory).

[API Development in .NET with GraphQL](https://www.lynda.com/NET-tutorials/API-Development-NET-GraphQL/664823-2.html)

> You should be able to register using your HOGENT account

> The next slides contain some information about **outdated sections**

---
### GraphQL (extra)
# Solution setup (1/2)

This is how to create the initial project setup:


```
mkdir GraphQLDemo
cd GraphQLDemo

dotnet new webapi -o Server
dotnet new classlib -o Orders
dotnet new sln -o .

dotnet sln .\GraphQLDemo.sln add .\Server\Server.csproj
dotnet sln .\GraphQLDemo.sln add .\Orders\Orders.csproj

cd Orders
rm .\Class1.cs
dotnet add package Bogus
dotnet add package GraphQL
dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
```

---
### GraphQL (extra)
# Solution setup (2/2)

```
cd ..\Server
# You don't need the Microsoft.AspNetCore.StaticFiles package
dotnet add package GraphQL.Server.Transports.AspNetCore
dotnet add package GraphQL.Server.Transports.Subscriptions.WebSockets
dotnet add package GraphQL.Server.Transports.AspNetCore.SystemTextJson
# Don't use GraphiQL, this playground is easier:
dotnet add package GraphQL.Server.Ui.Playground

dotnet add .\Server.csproj reference ..\Orders\Orders.csproj

dotnet remove package Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
rm -Recurse -Force .\Controllers
rm WeatherForecast.cs
```

In the `launchSettings.json`, change the `launchUrl` to `ui/playground`. This assumes
you have configured the GraphQL Playground instead of the GraphiQL playground.

Now open the solution remove the REST and Swagger stuff from the `Startup.cs` and move on with the tutorial!

---
### GraphQL (extra)
# Notes on the tutorial

- The tutorial is a little outdated, use the [GitHub](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/server#configure) and [documentation](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/introduction) to check which packages and APIs to use.
- You should not add the NuGet package resource
- Don't use any static files, there is a package for [GraphiQL](https://graphql-dotnet.github.io/docs/getting-started/graphiql)
- Use Bogus to fake data
- You know the project and folder structure can be done better

---
### GraphQL (extra)
# Notes on the tutorial

- Inject and hold a reference to the `IWebHostEnvironment`
- You also need this code in the `ConfigureServices` method

```
services.AddSingleton<IDocumentWriter, DocumentWriter>();
// singletons hier
services.AddGraphQL((options, provider) =>
  {
      options.EnableMetrics = Environment.IsDevelopment();
      var logger = provider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Startup>>();
      options.UnhandledExceptionDelegate = ctx => logger.LogError("{Error} occurred", ctx.OriginalException.Message);
  })
  .AddSystemTextJson()
  .AddErrorInfoProvider(opt => opt.ExposeExceptionStackTrace = Environment.IsDevelopment())
  .AddGraphTypes(typeof(OrdersSchema));
