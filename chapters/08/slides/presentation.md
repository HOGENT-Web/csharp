### Component Libraries
# Introduction
Components can be shared in a Razor class library (RCL) across projects. Include components and static assets in an app from:
- Another project in the solution.
- A referenced .NET library.
- A NuGet package.

Just as components are regular .NET types, components provided by an RCL are normal .NET assemblies. Just like class libraries.

> More information about Razor Class Libraries can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/class-libraries?view=aspnetcore-5.0&tabs=visual-studio">here</a>.

---
### Component Libraries
# Open source
A lot of components have already been created by the Blazor community and can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/AdrienTorris/awesome-blazor#component-bundles">GitHub</a>.
Please note that:
- Some are pay-to-use
- Simply bad
- Outdated
- Duplicate

However, some are worth mentioning:
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Blazored">Blazored</a>, small but extendable
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MudBlazor/MudBlazor">MudBlazor</a>, full suite of components
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit">bUnit</a>, testing library

> You can always implement and package your own components if you don't like any.

---
### Component Libraries
# Open source
The biggest pitfalls:
- Not reading the documentation
- Swashbuckling with how the library is setup
- Not doing research before you implement it in your project
  - Some are just wrappers around JavaScript and **really** slow
- The README of a GitHub repository is your documentation, use it
- If the documentation is bad, the package normally is too.
- Try not to use libraries which extensively use JavaScript, which can interfere with the virtual DOM of Blazor.

In this chapter, we'll use certain open source package, e.g.
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Blazored/Toast">Blazored.Toast</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Append-IT/Blazor.Sidepanel">Append.Blazor.Sidepanel</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation">Blazored.FluentValidation</a>

# Suit up, wear a fancy Blazor
> Bogus Store

---
### Sportstore
# Flashback
In chapter 6, we created a `blazorwasm --hosted` application. We used fakers and Bogus to get some initial data in our `client`. The `Client` was runnable, since everything was done on the `Client` and the `Server` was not yet involved.

In chapter 7, we created our business logic in 2 libraries, `Domain` and `Services`, so we can easily use a console app to do our bidding. We exposed our Data Transfer Objects using a REST API and made it possible to call the Server using the HTTPREPL and Swagger.

---
### Bogus Store
# Leap forward
In the following example we combined both applicaties so that:
- The `Server` serves the `Client`.
- The `Server` exposes REST API endpoints which are **partly** implemented.
    - You can navigate to `/swagger/index.html` to see the endpoints.
- The `Client` uses the <a target="_blank" href="https://bulma.io/">BULMA.io</a> CSS framework
    - It's like <a target="_blank" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> but **without any JavaScript**
- The `Client` calls the REST API endpoints using the `(I)ProductService` and a `HTTPClient`.
- The `Client` has it's authentication / authorization mocked in the `FakeAuthenticationProvider`.
- The `Server` has it's authentication / authorization mocked in the `FakeAuthenticationHandler`.
- The `Client` shows some functionality which is currently not working:
    - Filtering
    - Adding a product
    - Editing a product
    - ...

- Create a new product
- Edit an existing product
- Filter existing products based on certain criteria

> In a later chapter, we'll introduce real authentication and a real database, we'll be using the Fakers for now.

name:delete
### Bogus Store
# Delete Product
Implement the Delete Functionality.

On the Details page, there is a button called "Verwijderen", make it call the `IProductService` to actually delete the Product and navigate back to the Product Index page.
- Create a `onclick` EventHandler to call a function called `DeleteProductAsync`
- In the `DeleteProductAsync`, use the `IProductService`
- Inject the `NavigationManager` in the Detail component and use it to `navigate` to the list of products page.

# Delete Comfirmation
Implement the Delete Confirmation Functionality.

- Deleting something without a confirmation is **a big no-no**. Ask the user if he **really** wants to delete the product, if the answer is `yes`, delete the product else cancel the request.

name:create
### Bogus Store
# Create Product
Implement the Create Functionality.

- Create a new page with a code-behind file in the Client/Products folder called Create, with url `/product/create`.
- Make sure you can navigate from the `Toevoegen` button in the index page.
- Use the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Blazored/FluentValidation">Blazored.FluentValidation</a> library to create the form.
- Use the `ProductDto.Mutate` as model for the `EditForm`
- Use <a target="_blank" href="https://bulma.io/documentation/form/general/">BULMA's form components</a> to style the form accordingly
- After creation, navigate to the newly created product's detail page
- Notice that we generate a fake image url using the `Bogus` library.

### Uploading images
# Fake images

Currently we're using the `Bogus` library to generate fake images, but we're not actually uploading them to the server. This is quite tedious if you want to do it correctly and outside the scope of this course.

Some notes about uploading images:
- **Don't store images in your database**, unless they're small
    - A browser cannot **cache** the images
    - Server takes a **big perf. hit** when requesting multiple files
    - Usually a reference(**URI**) to where the image is stored is kept
- Store your images somewhere they can be **backed-up**
    - Usually a wwwroot folder is not backed-up by default
- Binary Large Object(**BLOB**) storage is generally a good choice
- Who can upload/download the images?
    - Depending on the use-case
    - Most of the time **only certain users can upload**
    - Some images can be public and some should be private
    - Think about Facebook, who can see these images?
- Let your **client stream images** to a BLOB storage

> A tutorial about image uploading in BLOB can be found <a target="blank" href='../../../optionals/blob/slides/index.html'>here</a>.

### BogusStore
# Create Product (Sidepanel)
Sometimes the user experience can be better when rendering a small sidepanel to show the form, so that we're not actually navigating away from the index page.
- Investigate the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Append-IT/Blazor.Sidepanel">Append.Blazor.Sidepanel</a> package on GitHub, especially the Forms functionality on the documentation website.
- Instead of navigating to the Product Create Page, use the Sidepanel component to show the form.

> Example on the next slide

name:edit
### Bogus Store
# Edit Product
Implement the Edit Functionality.

On the details page it should be possible to open a sidepanel which makes it possible to edit a product. Note that you should provide additional parameters to the sidepanel and a callback to refresh the details page once the edit is finished, since you'll be staying on the same page. Some help can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Append-IT/Blazor.Sidepanel/blob/3da32a817e93bf28efa29053d510169f1d7ae196/docs/Pages/Callbacks.razor#L36">here</a>.

- Implement the `ProductService` functionality.
- Create a new component with a code-behind file in the Client/Products folder called Edit.
- On the Detail page, Show the Edit form in the Sidepanel component, make sure to refresh the Detail page when the edit is finished.
- In the `ProductListItem` component, show the edit form in the Sidepanel component. Make sure to navigate to the Detail page when the edit is finished.

---
### Bogus Store
# Filter Products
Implement the filter functionality.  We'll implement the `SearchTerm` together, but you'll have to implement the other filters yourself.

The `SearchTerm` is a string which is used to filter the products by name and provided in the query string. e.g. `?searchTerm=product`

We'll be using `[Parameter, SupplyParameterFromQuery]`
```cs
    [Parameter]
    `[SupplyParameterFromQuery]`
    public string? Searchterm { get; set; }
```

> Note that **only** components with a `page "/"` directive can use the `[SupplyParameterFromQuery]` functionality. Which makes it impossible to use this functionality in the `ProductFilters` component. So we'll have to pass the `SearchTerm` to the `ProductFilters` component from the `Index` component.
>
> More information about providing parameters from the query string can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/routing?view=aspnetcore-6.0#query-strings-1">official docs</a>.

---
### Filter Products
**Index.razor.cs**

Add a `SearchTerm` parameter to the `Index` component.
```cs
[Parameter]
[SupplyParameterFromQuery]
public string? SearchTerm { get; set; }
```
Change the `OnInitializedAsync` lifecycle method to a `OnParametersSetAsync` and change the request to include the `SearchTerm`.
```cs
protected override async Task `OnParametersSetAsync()`
{
*   ProductRequest.Index request = new()
*   {
*       Searchterm = Searchterm,
*   };

    var response = await ProductService.GetIndexAsync(request);
    products = response.Products;
}
```

> Read more about lifecycle methods <a target="_blank" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/lifecycle?view=aspnetcore-7.0#when-parameters-are-set-setparametersasync">here</a>.

---
### Filter Products
**Client/Products/ProductService.cs**

Use the `Searchterm` in the `GetIndexAsync` method.

```cs
public async Task<ProductResult.Index> 
GetIndexAsync(ProductRequest.Index request)
{
    var response = await client.GetFromJsonAsync
    <ProductResult.Index>
    ($"{endpoint}`?searchterm={request.Searchterm}`");
    return response!;
}
```

> Notice the `?searchterm={request.Searchterm}` at the end of the url/query string. You can use a helper to create the url, but for now we'll just use string interpolation.

---
### Filter Products
Pass the parameter to the `ProductFilters` component.

**ProductFilters.razor.cs**
```cs
[Parameter, `EditorRequired`] 
public string? Searchterm { get; set; } = default!;
```

> Using the `EditorRequired` the compiler will shown a warning if the parameter is not provided when using the `<ProductFilter/>` component.

**Client/Products/Index.razor**
```cs
<ProductFilters `Searchterm="@Searchterm"`/>
```

---
### Filter Products
Bind the `Searchterm` to the input field.

**ProductFilters.razor**
```cs
<input class="input" type="search" placeholder="Zoeken..." 
       `value="@searchTerm" @onchange="SearchTermChanged"`>
```
> Notice that we cannot use the `@bind` syntax here, since we need to do some extra work when the value changes.
> 
> We'll use the `SearchTermChanged` method to update the `searchTerm` (field!) and navigate to the current page with the new `SearchTerm` parameters.
>
> Don't create a component that writes to its own parameters after the component is rendered for the first time. For more information, see the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#overwritten-parameters-1" target="_blank"> official docs</a>.

---
### Filter Products
**ProductFilters.razor.cs**
```cs
[Parameter, EditorRequired] 
public string? Searchterm { get; set; } = default!;

private string? searchTerm;

protected override void OnParametersSet()
{
    //Set the field equal to the parameter.
    searchTerm = Searchterm; 
}

private void SearchTermChanged(ChangeEventArgs args)
{
    // When the inputfield changes...
    searchTerm = args.Value?.ToString();
    FilterProducts();
}

private void FilterProducts()
{ // Navigate to the current page with the new SearchTerm parameter.
  Dictionary<string, object?> parameters = new();
  parameters.Add(nameof(searchTerm), searchTerm);
  var uri = NavigationManager.GetUriWithQueryParameters(parameters);
  NavigationManager.NavigateTo(uri);
}
```

---
### Filter Products
# Exercise
- Implement the other filters.
    - Minimum Price
    - Maximum Price
    - Category / Tag use `Id` of the tag

> Notice that the `Category` / `Tag` filters are not strings, but integers. So you'll have to use the `int.TryParse` method to convert the string to an integer.
>
> Notice that the `Price` filters are not strings, but decimals. So you'll have to use the `decimal.TryParse` method to convert the string to a decimal.
> 
> For now the Tags are hard coded but you can make them generic if you want by requesting them from the Server on load of the component.
> Do not forget to adjust the `ProductService`(s) as well.

# Tags
Make it possible to:
 - Show all tags in a table on the `/tag` page
    - Use 1 search parameter to filter the tags on name.
    - Use <a target="_blank" href="https://bulma.io/documentation/elements/table/">BULMA's table component</a> to style the table.
    - Only administrators can see the `tag` page and create them.
 - Create a new tag using the sidepanel component, make sure to refresh the table when the tag is created.

### Exercise
# Shopping Cart
Implement the Shopping Cart functionality, **only  client side**.

Make it possible to:
- Add products in a Shopping Cart.
- Remove products from the  Shopping Cart.
- Increase / Decrease quantity.
- Show the amount of items in the `Cart` in the `Header` component
- Show the total price all items.
- Show the Shopping Cart in a sidepanel component

Tips:
- Use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/state-management?view=aspnetcore-6.0&pivots=webassembly" target="_blank">State Management article</a> to put a `Cart` class in DI. 
- Make it possible for components to subscribe to the `OnCartChanged` event and make them re-render themselves when changes occur.
- New classes you'll need:
    - `Cart` Store in DI and inject it into components (See next slide)
    - `CartItem`
    - `ShoppingCart` (Component to render in the sidepanel)

### Switch to Blazor Server
# Tutorial.
Using the correct architecture you can (at this point) switch from Blazor WASM to Blazor Server. In a later stage the conversion becomes more difficult due to Authentication, Database access is not really a big problem. In most Blazor Server Apps, Cookies are used instead of JWT tokens.

We won't go into too much detail and leave it as an exercise, since the process how you can convert to Blazor Server is a great way to see if you understood the material of this and previous chapters.

- Tips:
    - Use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.appvnext.com/blog/2020/2/2/reuse-blazor-wasm-ui-in-blazor-server">this article</a> as a starting point.
    - You won't be needing the Client's services anymore, the interfaces of the shared project will suffice.

---
### Switch to gRPC
# Extra
Switch from REST to gRPC, we consider this as an extra exercise if you want to learn more about gRPC in combination with Blazor. 

> Note that this is not part of the course for the examination.

### Suit up, wear a fancy Blazor
# Summary

In this module you learned:
- The ins-and-outs of Blazor
- It's pretty powerful for native C# speakers
- Keep State in State objects via Dependency Injection
- Pass parameters and callbacks to other components
- Be aware of the render tree
- Uploading files to BLOB storage
- Use the EditForm component for advanced validated forms
- Do not mutate incoming parameters in components.
- Connect client-to-server via REST
- It's quite easy to switch from Blazor WASM to Blazor Server using the correct architecture
