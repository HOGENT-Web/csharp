### Try "Password123"
# Overview

This is not a security course, we're not even going to pretend it is. Learning all the aspects of security is a course all by itself.

However in this module we'll show how to setup Authentication and Authorization using Blazor WASM in combination with Auth0. 

There are multiple ways and identity providers you can use
- [Auth0](#auth0)
- [Azure AAD](#azure-aad)
- [Azure AD B2C](#azure-ad-b2c)
- [Identity Server](#identity-server)
- ... 

The problem is, these things change every year...

### Try "Password123"
# No Cookies for you

The engineering design of Blazor WebAssembly is settled on OAuth and OIDC as the best option for authentication in Blazor WebAssembly apps.
Token-based authentication based on JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) was chosen over cookie-based authentication for functional and security reasons.

However Blazor Server still uses cookies, which makes sense since everything is rendered on the Server.
